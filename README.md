<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

It's common practice to leave a quick `// TODO: come back and fix this or add that` type line when working through a build.

`SnitchRs` provides a way to find and track these lines

## Warning

This project is currently in an active state of development and is pretty unstable. Feel free to use but note things that can change might change.
